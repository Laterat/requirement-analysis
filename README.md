# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

This repository documents the process of Requirement Analysis for a booking management system as part of the ALX ProDev Challenge.

## üìå Purpose

The goal of this project is to simulate a real-world software development scenario by identifying, documenting, and analyzing functional and non-functional requirements. The project follows industry best practices and includes user stories, use case diagrams, and acceptance criteria to ensure clarity and alignment with user needs.
## üìñ What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is a critical phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) where the needs, goals, and expectations of stakeholders are gathered, analyzed, and clearly documented. It serves as the foundation for all subsequent stages of software development, ensuring that the final product is aligned with business objectives and user expectations.

### üîç Why Requirement Analysis is Important

- **Clarity and Understanding**: It helps the development team understand exactly what the stakeholders need, minimizing ambiguity and confusion.
- **Scope Definition**: Clearly defines what will be built and what will not, preventing scope creep and wasted effort.
- **Planning and Estimation**: Helps in accurately estimating time, cost, and resources required for the project.
- **Foundation for Design**: Guides the design and development of the system by providing a solid understanding of system requirements.
- **Ensures Quality**: Helps ensure the final product meets both functional and non-functional expectations, improving user satisfaction.

Requirement Analysis typically includes activities like requirement gathering, documentation, modeling, prioritization, and validation. It‚Äôs essential for building reliable, scalable, and user-friendly systems.
